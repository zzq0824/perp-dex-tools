## Strategy Overview

**Important Notice**: Everyone must first understand the logic and risks of this script so you can set parameters that are more suitable for yourself, or you might think this is not a good strategy and don't want to use it at all. As I mentioned on Twitter, I didn't write these scripts for sharing purposes, but because I'm actually using this script myself, so I wrote it, and then shared it.
This script mainly focuses on long-term wear and tear. As long as the script continues to place orders, if the price reaches your highest trapped point after a month, then all your trading volume for that month will be zero-wear. Therefore, I believe that setting `--quantity` and `--wait-time` too small is not a good long-term strategy, but it is indeed suitable for short-term high-intensity volume trading. I usually use quantity between 40-60 and wait-time between 450-650 to ensure that even if the market goes against your judgment, the script can still place orders continuously and stably until the price returns to your entry point, achieving zero-wear volume trading.

The bot implements a simple trading strategy:

1. **Order Placement**: Places limit orders near the current market price
2. **Order Monitoring**: Waits for orders to be filled
3. **Close Order**: Automatically places close orders at the take-profit level
4. **Position Management**: Monitors positions and active orders
5. **Risk Management**: Limits maximum number of concurrent orders
6. **Grid Step Control**: Controls minimum price distance between new orders and existing close orders via `--grid-step` parameter
7. **Stop Trading Control**: Controls the price conditions for stopping transactions through the `--stop-price` parameter

#### ⚙️ Key Parameters

- **quantity**: Trading amount per order
- **take-profit**: Take-profit percentage (e.g., 0.02 means 0.02%)
- **max-orders**: Maximum concurrent active orders (risk control)
- **wait-time**: Wait time between orders (prevents overtrading)
- **grid-step**: Grid step control (prevents close orders from being too dense)
- **stop-price**: When `direction` is 'buy', exit when price >= stop-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based termination)
- **pause-price**: When `direction` is 'buy', pause when price >= pause-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based pausing)

#### Grid Step Feature

The `--grid-step` parameter controls the minimum distance between new order close prices and existing close order prices:

- **Default -100**: No grid step restriction, executes original strategy
- **Positive value (e.g., 0.5)**: New order close price must maintain at least 0.5% distance from the nearest close order price
- **Purpose**: Prevents close orders from being too dense, improving fill probability and risk management

For example, when Long and `--grid-step 0.5`:

- If existing close order price is 2000 USDT
- New order close price must be lower than 1990 USDT (2000 × (1 - 0.5%))
- This prevents close orders from being too close together, improving overall strategy effectiveness

#### 📊 Trading Flow Example

Assuming current ETH price is $2000 with take-profit set to 0.02%:

1. **Open Position**: Places buy order at $2000.40 (slightly above market price)
2. **Fill**: Order gets filled by the market, acquiring long position
3. **Close Position**: Immediately places sell order at $2000.80 (take-profit price)
4. **Complete**: Close order gets filled, earning 0.02% profit
5. **Repeat**: Continues to the next trading cycle

#### 🛡️ Risk Management

- **Order Limits**: Limits maximum concurrent orders via `max-orders`
- **Grid Control**: Ensures reasonable spacing between close orders via `grid-step`
- **Order Frequency Control**: Controls order timing via `wait-time` to prevent being trapped in short periods
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors positions and order status
- **⚠️ No Stop Loss**: This strategy does not include stop-loss functionality and may face significant losses in adverse market conditions
